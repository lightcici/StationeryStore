Welcome to Team5, this is our AD Project~

Here we will write all the method need from back end.

For example: I need a method to retrieve a request by RequestID,
then I will find if there is any existing method with same function.

If you find there is no such method, please add the method and signature here:

// new method
// description of the method
public ArrayList<Request> findRequestByID(string RequestID);

That's it. Make sure you have spicified:
	1. return type (ArrayList<Request> in the example)
	2. parameters (string RequestID in the example)
	3. method name (findRequestByID in the example)
